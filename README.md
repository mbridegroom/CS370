# CS370

1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was given the base classes for the maze environment (TreasureMaze) and experience replay (GameExperience) along with a partially built Q-learning framework. I created the deep Q-learning training loop, the model-building code, and the optimizations to improve training efficiency and performance.

2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
Computer scientists design algorithms, write code, and create systems that solve complex problems, impacting industries from transportation to healthcare.

3. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I break the problem into smaller, manageable parts, analyze constraints, design an algorithm or system, test it iteratively, and refine based on results.

4. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I must ensure that my software is safe, reliable, and respects privacy, and I should communicate limitations or potential risks to protect both users and the organization.
